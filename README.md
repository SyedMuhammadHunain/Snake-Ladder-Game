#### PROJECT HIGHLIGHTS
* This file contains the main entry point for the Snake & Ladder game, managing the game loop, screen transitions, and resource loading/unloading using raylib for       graphical rendering.
* Secondly, we have made a file name Screen.h file which contains the implementation of a Snake & Ladder game using raylib, featuring title, player selection, name     input, gameplay, and end screens.
* Snake_Ladder.h file which contains the implementation of a function to check for snakes or ladders on the board, updating the player's position and displaying        messages for landing on a snake or climbing a ladder.
* The file Resources.h handles resource management for the Snake & Ladder game, including loading fonts, textures (dice faces, backgrounds, and logo), and ensuring     proper cleanup to manage memory efficiently using raylib.
* The file Info.h defines global constants, enumerations, and variables for managing the Snake & Ladder game's state, including screen transitions, player              information, game messages, and winner tracking.
* The Dice.h defines the dice rolling mechanics for the Snake & Ladder game, including animations, player updates, and special events like encountering snakes or       ladders.

#### HOW TO RUN
* In order to run the game
     * Create a folder and paste all the files there.
     * Your folder must contains Dice.h, Info.h, MAIN.c, Players.h, Resources.h, Screens.h, Snake_Ladder.h & a Resources Folder.
     * In Resources Folder there must be nine images including the Dice images(6 images), board images and a main background image and a logo image in png format.
     * In the Resources Folder there must be a Fonts Folder which contains a myfont.ttf file.
     * Now head over into the MAIN.c file and in the terminal write ./MAIN.exe & the game will be opened automatically.
     * Enjoy the game!
