* Snake_Ladder.h file which contains the implementation of a function to check for snakes or ladders on the board, updating the player's position and displaying        messages for landing on a snake or climbing a ladder.
* The file Resources.h handles resource management for the Snake & Ladder game, including loading fonts, textures (dice faces, backgrounds, and logo), and ensuring     proper cleanup to manage memory efficiently using raylib.
* The file Info.h defines global constants, enumerations, and variables for managing the Snake & Ladder game's state, including screen transitions, player              information, game messages, and winner tracking.
* The Dice.h defines the dice rolling mechanics for the Snake & Ladder game, including animations, player updates, and special events like encountering snakes or       ladders.
